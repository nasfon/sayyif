# Project Roadmap & Timeline

# Inventory Management System (IMS)

**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)

**Prepared By:** NasFon

> **Canonical reference:** the multi-tenant product evolution — billing, per-shop branding,
> feature flags, configurable roles, and white-label APK/AAB distribution — is specified in
> **`Product Architecture.md`** (the single source of truth). This document reflects the
> original MVP scope and is kept for reference; where the two conflict, the canonical
> document wins.

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the project phases, milestones, deliverables, task breakdown, dependencies, and estimated timeline for delivering the Inventory Management System (IMS) MVP.

It serves as the execution plan for the requirements defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and aligned with the System Architecture, Database Design, API Specification, and Frontend UI Specification.

---

# 2. Assumptions

The following assumptions are made for the MVP timeline:

* A small team (1-2 developers) is available.
* Supabase and Vercel are used as the hosting platform.
* No barcode scanner, supplier, or purchase order features are in MVP scope.
* Business rules (receipt format, currency) are finalized before Phase 2.
* Stakeholders are available for testing and feedback during each phase.

* Authentication must be complete before any protected module.
* Product module must be complete before sales module (stock deduction).
* Sales module must be complete before receipt and report modules.
* RLS policies must be tested before multi-shop go-live.

External Dependencies

* Business owner approval on receipt layout and currency format (confirmed: A4 + 80mm, NGN).
* Final decision on payment methods supported (cash, bank transfer, POS).
* Availability of sample product/customer data for testing.
