# 1. Purpose

This document defines measurable acceptance criteria for each module of the Inventory Management System (IMS) and the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process used to confirm the system is ready for go-live.

# 2. General Acceptance Criteria

* All features operate per the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
* Role-based access control works as defined in the Security & RBAC Design.
* Data is isolated between shops (RLS verified).
* All sensitive actions appear in audit logs.
* The application is responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Receipts can be printed and downloaded as PDF.
* No critical or high defects remain at sign-off.

# 3. Module Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Authentication

* A user with valid credentials can log in.
* A user with invalid credentials sees a clear error and cannot log in.
* An inactive account cannot log in.
* Logout ends the session and returns to the login page.

* Non-Super Admin users cannot access shop management.

## 3.3 Users

* Authorized admins can create, edit, activate, and deactivate users.
* A user is assigned to exactly one shop and one role.
* Deactivated users cannot log in.
* Users only see data from their assigned shop (except Super Admin).

## 3.4 Products

* Receipt shows the correct shop business information.

## 3.8 Sales Correction & Reversal

* Correction/reversal requires a reason.
* Reversal restores stock correctly.
* Corrected/reversed sales cannot be modified again.
* Every correction/reversal creates an audit log entry.

## 3.9 Credit Book

* Recent sales list is accurate.
* Data reflects the current shop (or global for Super Admin).

## 3.13 Audit Logs

* Sensitive actions produce an audit log entry.
* Logs include user, role, shop, action, resource, reason, date/time.
* Shop Admin sees logs for their shop only; Super Admin sees all.

## 3.14 Business Settings

* Business name, logo, phone, address, and receipt footer can be updated.
* Changes appear on receipts.
* Only authorized roles can update settings.

# 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## 4.1 Purpose

UAT confirms the system meets real business needs and is acceptable for daily use.

## 4.2 Participants

* Business owner / stakeholder (Super Admin).
* Shop Managers (Shop Admin).
* Cashiers (Cashier role).

## 4.3 Environment

* Staging environment (or a controlled production-like setup).
* Realistic test data (see Test Plan & Strategy section 6).

## 4.4 UAT Process

1. Provide UAT test scripts covering the priority flows.
2. Participants execute the scripts using their real roles.
3. Participants also explore freely and report issues.
4. Issues are logged, triaged, and fixed.
5. Retest critical issues.
6. Collect sign-off per role.

## 4.5 UAT Scenarios

* Super Admin: create a shop, assign a user, view global reports, view all audit logs.
* Shop Admin: manage products, customers, sales, credit, expenses; correct/reverse a sale; view shop reports.
* Cashier: create a sale, print receipt, view products and customers; verify cannot access admin pages.

## 4.6 UAT Sign-Off

* Each participant role signs off when their scenarios pass.
* Any critical/high issues must be resolved before sign-off.
* Written sign-off confirms the system is ready for production.
