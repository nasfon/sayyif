# 1. Purpose

This document defines the database structure for the Inventory Management System (IMS).

The database is designed to support:

* Multiple shops
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Inventory management
* Sales
* Customer credit management
* Expenses
* Audit logging
* Reporting

Database Engine:

* PostgreSQL (Supabase)

---

# 2. Database Principles

* UUID primary keys
* Foreign key constraints
* Soft delete support where necessary
* Automatic timestamps
* Referential integrity
* Shop-level data isolation
* Optimized indexing

---

# 3. Tables

## 3.1 Shops

Represents each business location.

Fields

* id (UUID, PK)
* name
* phone
* email
* address
* logo_url
* receipt_footer
* created_at
* updated_at

Relationship

* One Shop → Many Users
* One Shop → Many Products
* One Shop → Many Customers
* One Shop → Many Sales
* One Shop → Many Expenses

---

## 3.2 Roles

System roles.

Fields

* id

Notes

* Passwords are managed by Supabase Auth (`auth.users`) — no `password_hash` column in the business table.

# 5. Indexes

Create indexes on:

* shop_id
* role_id
* customer_id
* product_id
* sale_id
* receipt_number (Unique)
* phone
* sku (Unique per shop)
* created_at

---

# 6. Constraints

* Receipt Number must be unique.
* SKU must be unique within a shop.
* Product quantity cannot be negative.
* Selling price must be greater than zero.
* Expense amount must be greater than zero.
* Credit payment cannot exceed outstanding balance.
* Users can only belong to one shop.
* Every sale must belong to one shop.

---

# 7. Soft Delete Strategy

The following tables should support soft deletion using:

* deleted_at
* deleted_by

Applicable tables:

* Products
* Customers
* Users

Sales, Audit Logs, Stock History, and Credit Payments should never be deleted.

---

# 8. Row Level Security (RLS)

Every business table contains **shop_id**.

RLS policies ensure:

* Super Admin can access all shops.
* Shop Admin can only access their assigned shop.
* Cashier can only access records for their assigned shop.

---

# 9. Future Tables

Reserved for future releases:

* Suppliers
* Purchase Orders
* Purchase Items
* Barcode Labels
* Notifications
* Branch Transfers
* Inventory Adjustments
* Attachments

---

# 10. Naming Conventions

* Table Names: plural (products, sales)
* Primary Keys: id
* Foreign Keys: table_name_id
* Timestamps:

  * created_at
  * updated_at
* Soft Delete:

  * deleted_at
  * deleted_by

---

# 11. Database Summary

Total Core Tables (MVP)

1. shops

5. customers
6. sales
7. sale_items
8. credit_payments
9. expenses
10. stock_history

## 12. Multi-Tenant Extensions (Additive)

Per `Product Architecture.md`, the following are added for billing, branding, feature flags,
and configurable roles. They are **additive** — none of the core MVP tables above change.
Tenant = shop for v1 (no `organizations` table yet; `org_id` is reserved).

### 12.1 shop_billing

| Column | Type | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| shop_id | uuid PK → shops.id ON DELETE CASCADE | tenant = shop |
| plan | text CHECK IN ('onetime','monthly') | |
| status | text CHECK IN ('trial','active','past_due','expired','canceled') | |
| trial_end | timestamptz | default now() + 30 days |
| current_period_start | timestamptz | monthly only |
| current_period_end | timestamptz | monthly only |
| provider | text | 'paystack' |
| provider_customer_id | text | Paystack reference |
| provider_subscription_id | text | Paystack reference |
| provider_authorization | text | Paystack reference |
| updated_at | timestamptz | |

Index: `idx_shop_billing_status (status)`.

### 12.2 business_settings (branding columns, nullable)

Add `primary_color`, `accent_color`, `theme_mode` to the existing `business_settings` table.
Null = fall back to the default theme. Backward compatible.

### 12.3 shop_features

| Column | Type |
| ------ | ---- |
| shop_id | uuid → shops.id |
| feature_key | text |
| enabled | boolean |

Primary key `(shop_id, feature_key)`. Flags: `expenses`, `credit`, `reports`, `audit_logs`.

### 12.4 permissions + role_permissions

- `permissions` catalog (`permission_key`, `description`) — read-only seed.
- `role_permissions (role_id, permission_key, granted)` — data-driven within-shop checks,
  replacing role-*name* branching in RLS/RPC via `auth_has_permission(p text)`.
- `super_admin` remains hardcoded cross-tenant; never editable data.

### 12.5 Security helpers (SECURITY DEFINER, `set search_path = public`)

- `auth_has_permission(p text) returns boolean` — joins users → roles → role_permissions.
- `auth_has_access() returns boolean` — billing gate (trial / active / canceled / past_due
  within a 7-day grace).
- `auth_feature_enabled(feature text) returns boolean` — feature-flag gate.

All operational RPCs guard with `auth_has_access()`; policies keep `shop_id = auth_shop_id()`
as the first predicate.
