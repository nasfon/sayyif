# 1. Product Overview

The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a web-based application designed to help businesses efficiently manage products, customers, sales, customer credits, expenses, and inventory across multiple shops.

The system will simplify daily business operations by providing real-time inventory tracking, receipt generation, sales history, customer credit management, and business reports through a secure, role-based administrator dashboard.

The MVP focuses on reliability, ease of use, and accurate business record keeping across multiple shop locations.

# 2.5 Confirmed Business Rules

Confirmed by the business owner (Phase 0):

* **Discounts:** Not supported in the MVP. Sales are full-price only; no discount field exists in the schema, API, or UI.
* **Credit limits:** No hard credit limit per customer. Outstanding balance is tracked; a payment cannot exceed the outstanding balance, and marking fully paid sets the balance to zero.
* **Receipt layout:** A4 printable and 80mm thermal receipt formats are supported.
* **Currency:** Nigerian Naira (NGN, ₦) with 2 decimal places for all displayed and printed amounts.
